When you first start out on the map after you've died or just logged onto the game, you begin with a pistol, a knife, and some ammo. To get more items, however, you have to examine or loot objects.
Most objects you can loot are found inside buildings or houses. However, you cannot loot any objects outside, except for planters and bushes. To loot an object, simply walk up to it until you're bumping into it, then press the letter "Z". Once you've done so, the looting sound will play, and if there's anything inside that object, you'll get it in your inventory.
You can find everything you need to play the game in objects, such as ammunition, weapons, healing items, and explosives. Just know that if someone has looted an object shortly before you, there might not be anything inside. All you have to do is give it some time, and more items will appear inside if you loot it again.
You cannot do anything while you are looting an item, so to stop looting, simply press "Z" again, and you'll be able to move around like before.
