Some objects are movable. These include desks, tables, nightstands, and small filing cabinets. To move them, first locate a movable object from the list above. Then, make sure that the direction you want to move the object is not blocked by a wall or any other object.
Once you are sure it’s clear, walk up to the object on the side you want to move it towards, and press Shift + Enter. Each time you move it, you will hear a sound indicating the move was successful. You will need to walk up to the object again to move it further.
If this seems confusing, I will give you an example.
Let's say I'm in a house, and I want to block the door with a table. Here’s what I would do:
First, let’s assume the door is located on the eastern wall, and the table is in the center of the room. Obviously, I need to push the table east. Luckily, since the table is in the center of the room, it won't be blocked by anything. Simply go to the table's western side, and press Shift + Enter until you hear it hit the doorframe. Just like that, you've blocked the door. Objects can no longer be pushed if there's a wall in front of them, or if they can't fit through a doorway or window that you're pushing them towards.
