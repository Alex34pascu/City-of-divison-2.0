The church is quite a large building with a high, narrow tower on top. It is roughly 50 by 50 tiles and is located in the northwest part of the city, on Centria Street. Behind it is a graveyard, which you can reach by the two gravel paths that lead to it on the northern and southern sides of the church.
Entrances:
The church has one entrance on the east side of the building. It’s a wide doorway in the middle of the side of the structure.
Layout:
The layout of the church itself is quite simple. It’s one big open space, with wooden benches on the northern side, an altar on the west against the back wall, and a stairwell in the southwest corner leading to a stone walkway above the open space.
When you walk down the stone walkway, you will find another set of wooden stairs that lead up into the church’s tower.
The Tower:
The tower is a narrow structure extending through the church’s roof. There are a total of six flights of stairs you have to climb before reaching the top. At the top is a small room with a cabinet and a window overlooking the roof of the church, as well as the deep drop behind it.
The Graveyard:
The graveyard behind the church is a field with gravestones, a few planters, and some trees. There is nothing much of interest here, unless your life depends on it.
