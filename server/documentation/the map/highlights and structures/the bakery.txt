You can find the bakery on the westside of the city. It is located on Centria Street, southwest of the Centria Aetheron Street intersection. It is a small building, containing a cellar and a parking lot in front of it.
Entrances:
It has one main entrance on the Centria Street side, slightly south of the center of the building. Further south, next to the door, is a window.
Layout:
The bakery consists of one open space, with a display case dividing the front from the back section. There is a small open area south of the display case allowing you to get to the other side. To the north end of the space, there is a narrow door leading to a platform on top of a wooden staircase that leads to a basement.
The basement is mostly empty, apart from a few metal cabinets against the wall.
To the south and west of the bakery, are only houses.
