Items are quite an important part of the game. You can find them by examining objects that are lootable, by pressing the Z_key when standing infront of one.
You carry your items with you, by the  use of a tactical belt, which is kind of an inventory. You can scroll through your belt by holding down the Alt_key, and pressing left or right arrows.
For each item counts, that you can only carry a certain ammount of that item with you at the time.
Key strokes:
To receive some information about the currendly focussed item, press Alt I.
To give that item to a nearby player, press Alt G.
To store an item in a locker (when aplyable), press Alt S.
To use or activate a item, press enter.
Note: Ones you get killed, you will loose all the items you had collected so far.
