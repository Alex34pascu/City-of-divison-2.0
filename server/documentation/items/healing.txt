There are several items in the game that you can use to heal your self. They all got differend stats and can become handy in various situations
Pain_killer_injection: This is a small injection that hcan heal you up to A maximum of 75% health. One injection gives you 15% health each time. An advantage of this is that it is quick to use, and you can carry a total of 4 at MAX.
bandage: This is an item which can bring your health back up to 100%. Each time you use it, it restores 50% hp. The bandage is pretty handy due to the ammount of hp it can restore, but the time to use it is longer then for the pain_killer. You can carry three in total.
First_aid_kit: This is a rare healing item that also gets you back to full health. But in comparison to the other two items, this one will restore your health to 100%, no matter what your hp actually was before. It does take a long time to aply though, so you should keep that in mind. A disadvantage of the kit is that you can only carry one at  a time. It also takes nearly 17 seconds to aply, and during that period you can not move or fire a weapon.
Hint: When using a bandage or first_aid_kit, make sure you are alone, and preferably inside an inclosed space, so you can safely heal. For the pain_killers, those do not take long to use and can even be used during a fire_fight, when timed right.
