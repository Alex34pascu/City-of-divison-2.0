To access your weapons you can use the weapons menu. You can bring this up by clicking on the tab key.
The weapons are divided into 5 categories. These are melee, pistols, shotguns, sub_machine_guns, assault_rifles and sniper_rifles. To move through the categories, use the up and down arrows.
You can then find the weapons that belong to this category by using the arrows left and right.

The space key shows how much of that weapon you have in your inventory.
The I key provides information about the weapon such as the range, damage and the type of ammo being used.
And last we have the A key which shows how many bullets you have loaded into your weapon.

To exit the weapon menu, press Escape.
