City of division allows you to customize and modify the guns you find around the map. 
 You can attach different types of things onto different types of weapons. Smaller weapons would logically have less room for upgrades and therefore can not have the same potential maximum as a larger weapon.
Some upgrades you can add include things like longer barrels to increase the accurate range of fire for a weapon, attached stocks to stabilize the recoil of your weapon, extended magazines to hold more ammunition and many more.
To modify a gun, you need both materials and a toolbox. This will be discussed in a different article.
If you have a gun that has not had any modifications made to it, you may wish to discard it in order to hold a gun that potentially has had modifications made to it. If you simply wish to switch your focused gun from one to another, focus on the gun in the weapon menu and press shift space. If you press I, the stats of the weapon will be displayed. You can use this to focus an upgraded weapon. If you wish to discard one of your held guns, navigate to it and press backspace. This will drop the weapon, but be careful as there is no way to recover a gun once you scrap it. You are able to drop modified guns, so be careful when discarding.
In city of division, you are able to break your weapons. This means that different things damage the integrity of your weapon. Things like falling from large heights or repeatedly jamming your weapon will reduce the amount of overall health of the weapon, eventually leading to it breaking entirely.
You are not able to repair the damage to a weapon, so make sure to be careful with a gun if you have made modifications to it.
