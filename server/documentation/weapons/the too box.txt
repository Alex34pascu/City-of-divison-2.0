With the toolbox, you are able to craft attachments, which can be used on weapons. You can also clear a jammed firearm with it. The toolbox can be found in any object on the map, although it might be hard to find.
To craft an attachment, you need specific materials which are lootable on the map too. There are three types of materials: metal, plastic, and rubber. Metal is required for nearly any attachment, while the other two are used frequently.
When you open the toolbox, you’ll see the attachments available for the weapon you currently have drawn. The material costs for a specific attachment can vary per weapon, as they depend on the weapon’s tier. A tier 1 weapon (such as the Colt_M1911) will require less materials than a tier 3 weapon (such as the AK47).
Once an attachment is applied, you cannot remove it. So be careful with your weapon.
