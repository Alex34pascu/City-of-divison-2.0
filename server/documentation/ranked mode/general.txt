Ranked mode is a seperate game mode in which you will be fighting 1 vs 1 with an other player. Logically, the one who kills the other, wins and will receive rankingpoints. The player that loozes, will looze some ranking points.
With these points, you can buy special items that are connected to your account.
Note: Ranking mode is only available during the weekends.

To start a match, you need to be in the lobby. In the lobby menu, click ranked mode, and from there you can search for a match, check your points and view the rewards track.
When a match begins, both the players get to choose three weapons from a table. This is done in turns, and ones the last weapon has been chosen, the match starts.
Note: There is no loot to be found in the maps, so choose carefully.
