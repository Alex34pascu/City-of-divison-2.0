Getting headshots is a new feature in this game that you most likely haven't seen before. As you know, in real life, if someone gets shot in the head, 9 times out of 10, they're dead instantly. In this game, headshots don't kill instantly, but they increase the damage of the weapon you're using by 1.5 times.
To atain a headshot, you need to be higher than the player you're fighting. You can achieve this in several ways, such as jumping, standing on a planter, or using stairs while aiming down. Once you’re higher than your opponent and you manage to shoot and hit them, you'll get a headshot.
Note that you must be higher than your opponent to get a headshot, but you can only be up to 2 tiles higher on the Z-axis. For example, if your opponent is standing on the ground at Z 0 and you jump onto a planter that's 2 tiles high, that would work. However, if you jump onto a planter that's 3 tiles high, it would not work.
