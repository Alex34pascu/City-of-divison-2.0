the level system is designed to reward players for killing other players. If you manage to kill someone, you will receive XP which results in your level getting increased.
When reaching a higher level, you can unlock new skills.
To check which level you are, you can press (while on the map) the I-key. Here you can view your collected xp, as well as some other stats.
When you click on a player's profile, you can also see which level they are. Here, you can also see their survival time, and the skills they got in use.
In the server menu, which you can call up by clicking f4, you can see all the levels and find out which level unlocks what.
