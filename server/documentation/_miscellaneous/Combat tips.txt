Alright, let's get into it. Combat in this game is different from other games for the following reasons:
First, the map isn't open; it's a city instead. In the city, you'll find buildings like houses, a mall, a church, and many other large structures. Each building has a unique layout and object placement. So, my first tip for you is to learn the layout of the most common buildings where people fight. Learn the layout and where everything inside is. If you do this, you'll have many advantages over people who don't know the map as well as you do.
My next tip is to utilize cover anytime you can. Even if no one is around, you never know when a sniper might be watching you. All objects block bullets until they are destroyed, but that rarely happens in combat unless explosives are used. If you're fighting someone, always stay behind something to protect yourself. You never want to be caught out in the open. Also, make sure you move often. People can and will find angles to shoot you from, even if you're behind something. So, move frequently if you can to keep your opponent on their toes.
Additionally, always take the better position if you can. This depends on the person you're fighting and how good both you and they are, but I'd much rather be at the top of a staircase than in a doorway if I were fighting in a building. This is because if someone comes up the stairs or even just stands at the bottom, you can get headshots, which do 1.5 times the damage compared to normal hits.
My last tip is to not panic. If you're moving and jumping often without breaks during combat, you'll be an easy target because people can hear you and easily aim at you. Just remember that people need to hear a sound from you to find and target you. Keep a level head and avoid making any dumb choices that will put you in a bad spot. Of course, we've all done this, but try to avoid it whenever you can.
