Skills are in the game to make the battles varied.
This is because every player can put together their own skill set and use these skills in combat.
When you reach a higher level you can unlock new skills.
You can see your own skills by clicking on manage skills in the lobby menu. Here you can put together your skill set and you can also see the skills you have unlocked. You can also upgrade the skills in that menu.
