Traps are being used to protect your metal_fortress or locker. You can order them via the team phone, and place them inside or around your hideout.
At the moment, there are 2 traps:
Spiketrap: This is a 1 by 1 tile trap, that shoots a spike ones a person steps on to it. 
Tripwire: This is a thin rope attached to a explosive. Ones a player disturbs the rope, it will detonate the explosive.
Defences:
Currently, there are 2 types of defence: The barricade and the build in alarmsystem.
Barricade: This is a wooden wall, that you can place somewhere near your fortress. Allthough it won't hold for very long, it will slow your enemies down.
Build_in alarmsystem: This comes with your fortress, and can be activated or deactivated with the team phone. It will alert you and your teammembers when the fortress is under attack, or a non authorized player enters in side.
If there is any person in the fortress while the alarm is turned on, everyone will be electrocuted. This counts for both teammembers and other players.
It is possible to turn the alarmsystem off, even if you're not a member of the team. To do so, you have to press shift enter at the fortress, and do a simon game of 35 sounds. Keep in mind though, that each wrong try, will electrocute you, but you have 5 tries before you die.
