If you're the leader of a team, you need to know how to manage it. To access everything you need, go to the Teams menu in the lobby, then select Your Team. In there, you have several options to manage your team.
In your team profile, you can see the members of your team. You can press Enter on their usernames to get more options. "View invites and requests" is pretty simple. If anyone has sent a request to join your team, you can accept or decline them here. To send an invite to someone to join your team, go to the players list with F2 when you're out of any menu. Click Enter on their name, and you will see an option to send an invite to join your team.
The next option is "Change the leader of your team." This lets you choose a member from your team to be the leader if you wish to do so. If you do this, you won't be the leader anymore and will just be a normal team member. The last option for a team leader is "Cancel the team." This simply disbands your team. If you want another one, you will have to create a new team again.
