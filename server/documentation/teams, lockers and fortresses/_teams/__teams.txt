Teams let you and others fight as a unit. You can create a team by going to the lobby, hitting Enter to access the menu, and finding the Teams option. When you hit Enter on that, you have a few options:
Your Team, Create Team, Send a Request for a Team, view all teams, and view all teams with a locker. Most of these should be self-explanatory and are fairly simple to use.
When you're on the map fighting with your team, you can press Y to team chat. This means only your team members can see your messages, which is very useful for communicating with them. Another thing to note is that when you're near a team member on the map, your infrared scanner will make a beep sound as if they were a normal player, except a team member's beep sounds differend so you can tell that they're on your team.
In this game, you can hit your other team members as well, so always keep that in mind when fighting together.
From version 1.4, the team's kills are being registered and calculated. For a certain ammount of kills, the team will gain team tokens which you can use for various purposes.
