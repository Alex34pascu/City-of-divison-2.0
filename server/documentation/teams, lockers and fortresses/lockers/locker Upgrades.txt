Once you have a locker placed, you can upgrade it. The main reason you would want to do this is to make it more secure against people trying to break into it.
To upgrade your locker, you first need team tokens, which you get by opening chests. With those team tokens, you go to your team locker, press Shift + Enter to open the door, and hit Z. Then you can go to the bottom of the menu to an option called View Upgrades.
Once you've opened it, you have three upgrade options: Maximum Health, Security, and Storage.
• Maximum Health: This upgrade will increase your locker's maximum Solidity Points, making it harder to destroy. By default, it's 20,000.
• Security: Security for lockers is interesting. To break into a locker, you have to do a game of Simon sounds. For each wrong try, you hve to start all over again.
• Storage: This upgrade increases the amount of items you can store in your locker. The higher the level of your storage, the more things you can keep inside.
