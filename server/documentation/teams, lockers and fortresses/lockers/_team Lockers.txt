Once you have created a team, you are now able to have a team locker. You get a locker by going to the lobby, entering the Teams menu, and selecting Your Team. Once you're there, you will see an option to get a locker. Now, when you go onto the map again, you will have a locker in your inventory. You are free to place it anywhere on the map.
Just be sure, when placing a locker, to put it in a secure location. Also, when you've found a spot, make sure there's enough space for your locker to be placed on the map. You need three tiles of empty space. For example, if I were placing it against a wall, I would back up from the wall three steps and then place it.
You are allowed to store items in your locker. You store items from your belt by moving to the item you want to put inside the locker with Alt + Left Arrow and Right Arrow. Once you've found it, you hit Alt + S, and it will ask you how many of that item you want to store. Once you've typed in the desired amount, it is now in the locker.
The process is mainly the same for the weapons menu. You just open the weapons menu with Tab, go to the weapon category you want, use the Right Arrow to get to the weapon, and hit S again. Just a thing to note here: unlike the belt, where you type in the amount of items you want to put in the locker, in the weapons menu, if you push S once, that's one weapon. So, you have to push it as many times as needed to put the desired quantity of weapons in the locker.
You can retrieve items from your team locker by walking up to it, hitting shift enter which opens the locker door. And now you are able to push Z to get items inside.
